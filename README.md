Our todo list app is a web-based application that allows users to create and manage their own personal todo lists. The app is built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend.

Users can create new todo items and assign them a priority level and a due date. They can also mark items as complete, delete them, or edit them as needed. The app also provides a search function that allows users to filter their todo items by keyword or status.

In addition to basic todo management, the app also offers a few additional features to help users stay organized and on track. For example, users can set up email reminders to be sent to them on the due date of a todo item, or they can view their todo list in a calendar view to get a better overview of their upcoming tasks.

Overall, our todo list app is a powerful and user-friendly tool for managing daily tasks and staying organized. Whether you are a student, a professional, or a busy parent, this app is sure to help you stay on top of your todo list and get more done each day.
